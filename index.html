    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">My Career Journey</h2>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 1: The Roots of Leadership (2013–2016)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">I started with a degree in Human Resources Management, driven by the desire to understand and lead people. But I soon realized I wanted to challenge myself further — not just in organizations, but in high-stakes environments. That realization sparked a new path.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 2: Becoming an Officer (2017–2018)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">In 2017, I applied and was accepted into the Portuguese Air Force Officer School. The 8-month course was more than physical — it was mental conditioning and leadership training of the highest intensity. It laid the foundation for everything that came after.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 3: Forged in the Azores (2018–2020)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">Stationed at the NATO base in Lajes, I served as second-in-command in HR, Finance, and Acquisitions. This was where I learned the real-world value of logistics, diplomacy, and how to lead multicultural teams under pressure.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 4: Into the Fire – Special Forces (2020)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">In 2020, I pushed myself further by enrolling in the Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Special Forces training. It was the hardest six months of my life — physically, mentally, emotionally. From combat scenarios to advanced metrology, I earned qualifications that few attain, and the mindset that comes with them.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 5: Leading Through Complexity (2020–2022)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">Returning to Lajes, I continued in my leadership role and became the point of contact for major NATO operations — including Frontex, Real Thaw, and Tiger Meet. I also earned my Search and Rescue (SAR) certifications at BA4 and BA6. Every mission required precise coordination and unshakeable calm.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 6: Strategic Vision in Lisbon (2022)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">After promotion to Lieutenant, I was assigned to headquarters in Lisbon, where I supported executive decisions and gained visibility into military-wide planning. It deepened my ability to think strategically and act decisively.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 7: The Final Command (2023–2024)</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">At BA6 in Montijo, I returned to operations and HR leadership, but this time with more purpose. I managed critical exercises while mentoring younger officers. I knew I was ready for a new mission — one where I could have both impact and balance.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Chapter 8: A New Mission – Civilian Life</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">In late 2024, I chose to end my military chapter and moved to Dublin to enter the corporate world. My experience led me naturally into tech sales — a world that demands resilience, adaptability, and people skills. I’m now focused on building relationships, solving problems, and contributing to fast-paced teams.</p>

      <blockquote class="mt-6 border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700">
        "I didn’t just lead missions — I led people through chaos, uncertainty, and success. That’s the same energy I bring into every business conversation today."
